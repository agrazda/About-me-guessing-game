        <h2>A little about my life!</h2>
          <p>Born and raised in Washington State. I moved to Oregon on a Track and Field scholarship. I met my wife in 2012. We got Married in 2019. Our first child was born in 2020. </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I Went to college for track and field (Not for Education). I ended up having a hamstring injury and that ended my college education. Now I attend Code Fellows, where I am studying to be a computer programer.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Vans Shoes - 10 years Store Managment and 6 year Grand Opening Manager</li>
            <li>Factory Finish Auto Body - 5 years as Operations Manager</li>
          <ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>My main goal at this moment is to graduate Code Fellows and find a career that will allow me to work remote. I would like a remote career because my second goal is to take life on the road with my family and travel the US and even the world. </p>
